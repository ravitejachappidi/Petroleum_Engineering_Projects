## ./Shale Rock Prediction with ML

Shale Rock Presence during drilling has very much importance and its identification plays major role to tak efurther actions. By integrating well logging with ML we can identify Presence of Shale Rock efficiently.


## ./Single Rate Build Up Test Analyzer

It is a Web Interface that provides a file uploading feature when a file with presuure with respective time during BuildUp if uploaded that can do further Interpretation from the Results using Horners Approximation.


## ./Well Logging With ML

Well Logging is about identifying the patterns followed by different logs to identify the different lithologies. ML main idea is to automate the pattern finding job. So by implementing ML to interpret well logs is helpful which makes the process fast and efficient.
